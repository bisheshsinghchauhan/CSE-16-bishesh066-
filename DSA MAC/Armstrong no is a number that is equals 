% Armstrong no
is a number that is equals to the 
sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digit


% Febonacci series
is the sequence where each number is the 
sum of the previous 2 numbers of the sequences


% print pairs of numbers , like 
i=2 ; j=4
i=4 ; j=8;
i=3 ; j=3;



break=used to terminate the loop immediatly.
continue=skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
array=multiple loop variables.

% Array

Array=An array is a collection of data items of the same type that are stored in
countigues memory locations
Syntax=Data type arr-var[Size].  - ex-intarr[5]/chararr[6]/floatarr[10]
where data type is int/char/float etc

indexing starts from 0 memory is statically alocated at compile time.
array is a homogenous type of element(only one type like int char etc)

[5][10][11][12][14][15]--array elements and boxes are memory 
0---1---2---3---4---5--(index array) - array size = 6


(1)Traversing(printing all elements of an array)
(2)Searching(Linear and Binary)
(3)Sorting(Bubble,Selection,Insertion)
(4)Insertion(At the beginning,At the end,At a given position)
(5)Deletion(At the beginning,At the end,At a given position)

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable,
instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
Array is the big size of elemets of the same data type. 
stored in a countigues memory and indexing starts from 0.

% Array writting technique-

int/floatarr[5] --declaring an array of 5 elements of
int- data type
arr-var- array variable
Size- number of elements in the arrays in the number.

% Array Item Sorting - 


address
-----------------------------
 29 | 75 | 69 | 22 | 2 | 95 | ----(29,75,69,22,2,95) array elements and n=6
-----------------------------
--0----1----2----3----4---5--(index)

linear search(A,N,item)--(Let us say 22 is our number)
1.loc=-1
2.i=0
3.Repeat while i<N and A[i]=/item
            0<6.         29=/22
            1<6.         75=/22
            2<6          69=/22
            3<6          22=22  --found
4.if i<N
     loc=i
    return loc


% Sorting(Bubble Sort) -
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
29-75-69-22-2-95


% Sorting Type-
1.Selection Sort = find the minimum element in unsorted array and swap it with element
at beginning and follow the process till we get a accending order/desscending order
/whatever se want in order.(Multiple Steps)
2.Bubble Sort = We consider a elemet as a bubble , and compare it with the second
one and do this till the end of the number , it is not mendatory to get 
accending order/desscending order/whatever se want in order in 1st round
so it will do another round to get the outcome we want(Multiple Round = 1Round + Steps)

%Linear search(A,N,item)--(Let us say 22 is our number)
Array - 29-75-29-22-2-95 --(29,75,69,22,2,95) array elements and n=6
where 22 is our item to be searched.
1.loc=-1
2.i=0
3.Repeat while i<N and A[i]=/item(for this loop i++)
            0<6.         29=/22
            1<6.         75=/22
            2<6          69=/22
            3<6          22=22  --found
4.if A[i]=item then
5.loc=i if not found then we get -1 in loc which means not found.
6.return loc
